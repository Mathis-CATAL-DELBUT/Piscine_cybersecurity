## SQL Injection Detection Tool

# Description:
This Python tool detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications by interacting with a given URL and attempting various SQL injection payloads.
It identifies database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL and SQLite and logs the results if vulnerabilities are found.
The tool also offers an option to archive the results in a zip file.

# Features:
- SQL Injection Detection: Attempts various payloads to identify SQL vulnerabilities.
- Database Identification: Recognizes the database type (MySQL or SQLite) through HTTP headers and error messages.
- Logging Results: Logs the findings, including the differences in HTML content before and after injection.
- Archiving: Compresses the log results into a zip file after execution.

# Usage:
python script.py <URL> [-X GET|POST] [-o archive.log]
